Also please report any issues and bugs you might find! Development To start development you can clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/petereon/beaupy.git Change the directory to the project directory: cd ./beaupy/ This project uses poetry as a dependency manager. You can install the dependencies using: poetry install For testing, this project relies on ward . It is included as a development dependency, so after installing the dependencies you can simply execute the following: poetry run poe test After you have made your changes, create a pull request towards a master branch of this repository Looking forward to your pull requests!
